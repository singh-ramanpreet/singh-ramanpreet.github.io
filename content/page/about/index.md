Hi, I'm **Ramanpreet**. I'm a problem solver. I love learning new skills and creating solutions to problems.

I'm currently working as control software engineer at Best Automation and Robotics in Loves Park, IL USA.

I completed my Ph.D. Physics (Experimental High Energy Physics) at [Northern Illinois University](https://niu.edu/physics) in 2022. I worked on the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern/) at [CERN](https://home.cern/) in Geneva, Switzerland. The experiment provided petabytes of proton-proton collision data. Analyzing this amount of data is a challenge in itself and searching for rare signal is even more challenging. I worked on searching for a vector boson scattering process that is a rare process and is a key to understanding the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism. In addition to this, I worked on developing new detector for the [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern/) which will replace the current endcap calorimeter before the High Luminosity run of the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](https://home.cern/).
